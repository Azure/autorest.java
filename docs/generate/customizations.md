# <img align="center" src="../images/logo.png"> Java-Specific Customizations

This section shows you how to use customizations when generating your code. You can also use directives to change your code, see how to do so in our [main docs][main_docs].

These customizations require defining classes where the code will generate in the [`azure-sdk-for-java`][azure_sdk_for_net] repo. See [here][customizations] for the
different customizations.
