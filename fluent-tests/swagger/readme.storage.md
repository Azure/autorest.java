# Resource

This is the AutoRest configuration file for Resource.

Different reference to common-types/resource-management/v1/types.json and common-types/resource-management/v5/types.json would cause de-duplication of "Resource" to "ResourceAutoGenerated" in m4.
But "ResourceAutoGenerated" should not be generated in code.

``` yaml $(java)
